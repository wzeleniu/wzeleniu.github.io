        <desc id="descr"> Description: <br> Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist best known for developing the theory of relativity. <br> <br>
        His massâ€“energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special relativity, has been called "the world's most famous equation". <br> <br> He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for "his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". <br> <br> Einsteinium, a synthetic chemical element, was named in his honor in 1955, a few months after his death. <br> (Wikipedia as source for all of above.)</desc>
